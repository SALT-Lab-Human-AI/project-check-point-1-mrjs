# Project Proposal: AI-Powered Tools to Support Educators Working With Children With Autism

## Problem & Importance
Teachers who support autistic students need a fast, accurate way to capture what happened during conflicts, but in real classrooms they can’t stop to type long notes, so details often get lost. When records are messy or missing, it’s harder to spot patterns, adjust supports, and share clear updates with parents and specialists. Our project aims to fix this by making incident logging and organization quick and simple with voice-to-text, auto-summaries, and smart tags - turning a painful admin chore into a simple habit that actually helps students. In the long run, this can improve communication, reduce teacher stress, and create a more supportive environment for students.

## Prior Systems & Gaps
- AI-powered behavior tracking tools and incident logging apps exist that attempt to document observations through manual entry or some voice recognition features. However, many require significant manual input, lacking real-time voice-to-text integration combined with meaningful summaries and tagging ([Li et al., 2024](../literature/Teachers%20and%20educators%E2%80%99%20experiences%20and%20perceptions%20of%20artificial-powered%20interventions%20for%20autism%20groups.pdf)).
- Specialized speech-to-text and dictation software are widely used in education, but these often are generic and not tailored to the nuanced documentation needs of autistic-related behaviors in busy classrooms ([Nebraska Autism Spectrum Disorders Network, 2018](https://asdnetwork.unl.edu/virtual-strategies/abc-data/)).
- Behavior analytic tools commonly use ABC (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence) data collection frameworks but remain manual and fragmented, rarely integrated into a seamless AI-powered workflow for teachers ([Nebraska Autism Spectrum Disorders Network, 2018](https://asdnetwork.unl.edu/virtual-strategies/abc-data/)).
- Some AI interventions focus on improving engagement via interactive games, virtual reality, or robots, but they do not address efficient, accurate record-keeping or teacher workflows ([Li et al., 2024](../literature/Teachers%20and%20educators%E2%80%99%20experiences%20and%20perceptions%20of%20artificial-powered%20interventions%20for%20autism%20groups.pdf)).

## Proposed approach and why it will improve on prior systems
Our initial concept is to build a simple AI-powered tool with two main features: a Voice-to-Text Incident Logger with Auto-Summary and an AI Document/File Organizer that Tags & Summarizes Notes. Teachers can press a button, describe what happened, and instantly get both a transcript and a short summary of the conflict. The system will then store the record, add tags such as student name, type of conflict, and date, and keep everything organized in one place for easy searching and reviewing. This creates clearer communication with specialists and parents, makes support plans more effective, and turns documentation into a quick, reliable process instead of a stressful chore.

Existing tools already provide valuable services but focus on different aspects of special education. [Panorama](https://www.panoramaed.com/) is a generalized student information and analytics platform, while [AbleSpace](https://www.ablespace.io/) is tailored for special education professionals, emphasizing goal tracking, progress monitoring, and communication with families. Neither is optimized for **real-time, speech-driven incident capture**. Our approach improves on these tools by enabling teachers to **save significant time by speaking their reports** directly in the classroom context, generating instant transcripts and editable summaries without disrupting instruction.

A further improvement lies in our **AI-powered tagging and document organization**. Each record is automatically categorized by student, type of conflict, antecedent, and consequence, producing a structured archive that can be searched and analyzed for patterns over time. This helps teachers and specialists identify recurring triggers more efficiently and adjust supports accordingly. In this way, the tool complements existing systems by filling a critical gap: efficient incident documentation that is both autism-specific and designed to reduce teacher workload.

## Plan for Checkpoint 2
1. Collaboratively develop a prompt engineering strategy by co-creating a centralized document that contains all testing prompts to be used in the audit to ensure consistency, version control, and systematic evaluation across all AI tools.
2. Conduct the audit involving 4+ AI and agent tools, such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot Studio, and NotebookLM, assigning each tool to a dedicated team member to evaluate whether a single tool meets all project requirements or if a combination of tools provides the best solution.
3. Collect transcripts and outputs from the audit, followed by conducting a comprehensive gap analysis conducted together as a team to identify strengths and areas for improvement.
4. Next steps to be distributed evenly once we determine the best tool(s) to create our prototype and we discuss personal strengths further:
    - Draft the DESIGN_SPEC.md document encompassing user journeys, task flows, and key screen designs to guide development.
    - Develop a lightweight prototype using Figma or a sandbox environment demo to visualize and test core interactions.
5. Present findings from prompt testing, highlight observed gaps, and propose our refined concept based on audit insights to the class.

## Initial risks & mitigation (privacy, bias, safety, reliability)
As [Nguyen et al. (2023)](../literature/Ethical-principles-for-AI-in-education.pdf) emphasize, trustworthy educational AI must be designed around principles of fairness, human-centeredness, accountability, transparency, and privacy. For our project, this means ensuring that teachers remain in control of all AI-generated records, with summaries and tags always reviewable and editable before becoming part of a student’s file. Because these records would likely qualify as education records under FERPA ([U.S. Department of Education, 2023](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/ferpa)), the system must also incorporate strict safeguards such as role-based access for school officials with a legitimate educational interest, mechanisms for parents or eligible students to review and request corrections, and procedures for obtaining consent when information is shared beyond the school. Privacy protections are particularly important in this context, given the sensitive nature of documenting incidents involving children with autism.

Beyond compliance, the tool must also account for the wide spectrum of experiences encompassed by Autism Spectrum Disorder. The variation in symptoms and severity means that no single template will fit all cases, so the system must be flexible and avoid rigid or biased categorizations that could reinforce stereotypes. Finally, educators have raised concerns that over-dependence on AI tools might risk displacing essential human judgment ([Li et al., 2024](../literature/Teachers%20and%20educators%E2%80%99%20experiences%20and%20perceptions%20of%20artificial-powered%20interventions%20for%20autism%20groups.pdf)). To mitigate this, our design emphasizes teacher oversight, transparency in how AI-generated tags are applied, and training for educators so that the technology complements rather than replaces professional expertise.
