### Summary  
This 12-month observational study evaluated the Cognitivebotics AI-based therapy platform with 43 children aged 2–18 years diagnosed with autism. Participants were divided into intervention and control groups, with standardized assessments (CARS, VSMS, DST, REEL) taken at baseline and after 12 months. The intervention group, which consistently used the platform alongside therapy, showed significant improvements in social maturity, developmental age/quotients, receptive and expressive language and reductions in autism severity scores. The study highlights how AI-assisted learning, gamified activities and parent involvement can boost therapy effectiveness. However, the authors note that wider accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and user-friendliness are critical for future scaling.  

### Insights Learned  
1. The integration of daily structured digital sessions with therapy significantly improved social, language and developmental outcomes.  
2. Gamified, AI-driven activities kept children engaged while also collecting detailed progress data automatically.  
3. Parental involvement and training were key to sustaining consistency and maximizing impact.  

### Limitations/Risks  
1. The sample was limited geographically, so findings may not generalize to global contexts.  
2. As a preprint, peer review is still pending—replication and validation are needed to confirm results.  

### Idea for Our Project  
This paper suggests our emotion journaling tool could also include structured progress tracking and gamified feedback, similar to Cognitivebotics. It could automatically visualize trends for teachers/parents, helping identify patterns in emotional regulation or conflict triggers.

## A Review of Artificial Intelligence Interventions for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder

### Summary  
This review analyzed 13 empirical studies (2018–2024) that tested AI interventions in autism education, including robots, smart glasses, AR/VR tools and game-based platforms. Most focused on improving social interaction, emotional recognition and communication skills, with consistent positive results such as better eye contact, motivation, and emotion labeling. However, most studies were small-scale, often pilot projects with limited diversity and short timelines. The review concludes that AI can enhance learning and engagement for autistic students but highlights gaps in long-term validation and standardized practices.  

### Insights Learned  
1. Game-based interventions and immediate feedback were especially effective, aligning with autistic students’ need for structure and repetition.  
2. AI systems like smart glasses and robots can directly support emotion recognition and eye contact, core challenges in autism.  
3. Teacher/parent involvement in implementing interventions greatly boosted their effectiveness.  

### Limitations/Risks  
1. Studies were small and fragmented, lacking standardization, which makes it hard to compare or generalize outcomes.  
2. There’s little long-term data showing whether improvements last beyond the intervention period.  

### Idea for Our Project  
This review inspired us to make sure our incident logger and emotion journaling tool also include immediate, structured feedback loops and clear summaries. Just like game-based interventions improve engagement, our logger could highlight repeated triggers or successful interventions after each entry, while the journaling tool could give weekly insights that teachers and parents can use together. This makes our tools not just record-keepers, but active supports for learning and collaboration.
